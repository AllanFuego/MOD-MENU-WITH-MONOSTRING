# MOD-MENU-WITH-MONOSTRING
Hello Guys.
My name is 
# **ALLAN FUEGO.**
Today I brought to you a new and enhanced version of lgl template with hooking support. 
In this template you can simply do all the things that you did in lgl like libpatching, hooking, but I also added a new feature monostring hooking which is really a very important feature. 
With monostring hook you can simply edit strings of game like player name or anything like it in the game.
I uploaded this source because many new modders who were new to modding field ask me how to make monostring hooks in normal lgl or they tried by their own but don't know what to do in real and got error so I created this post. Thanks for giving your precious time. 
Have a nice time in moddingüíï

Here is a monostring hooking tutorial by Slice Cast from platinmods.
